    <p>Quick, easy, and yummy beef empanada recipe. Perfect as a meal served with my rice and beans recipe or as appetizers at a party.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup diced bell pepper</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup seeded, finely chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>¼ cup sofrito (such as Goya®)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped raisins</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>½ cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped Spanish olives</li>    
        <li>2 (1.41 ounce) packages sazon seasoning (such as Goya®)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>2 (14 ounce) packages frozen empanada shells (such as Goya® discos), thawed</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease; remove beef to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook onions, bell pepper, and garlic in the same pan over medium heat until peppers are soft and onions are translucent, making sure not to brown or burn garlic, about 5 minutes. Add beef back into the pan and stir to combine. Add tomatoes, sofrito, and raisins; cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in chicken stock, tomato sauce, cilantro, olives, sazon, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let mixture cool slightly, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine beaten egg and water in a small bowl. Spoon filling mixture evenly into the middles of the thawed empanada discs. Brush edges with egg and water mixture, fold in half, and seal the edges with a fork.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fry empanadas in the hot oil, working in batches if needed, until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes, turning halfway through.</li>
    </ol>
